				<p>This page is a demo of an object-oriented web scraper.  Each node of the HTML can be evaluated by a Condition.  In this example, two conditions are evaluated: having a certain ID and
				having specific anchor text.  These conditions are used to isolate hyperlinks which have the word 'game' in its anchor text on the <a href="http://www.dmoz.org">DMOZ homepage</a>.
				</p>
				<p>Note that polymorphism is not used; in other words, any place that uses Conditional can be replaced by a subclass of it.  In PHP5, type hinting parameters can be used with Polymorphism.  Likewise,
				traversing a data structure can take advantage of polymorphism.  Ultimately I think the best use would be in PHP 5.6+ which allows parametric lists; one or more values can be used as parameters.  In this case
				that can mean one or more Conditionals being passed to a function.  Experiment away!</p>
